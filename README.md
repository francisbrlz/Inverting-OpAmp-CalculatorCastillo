# Inverting-OpAmp-CalculatorCastillo
A non-inverting OpAmp configuration allows you to take any input voltage and amplify it based on the gain (ratio between resistor2 and resistor 1). since the OpAmp configuration is inverted, hence the output will be the opposited or inverted of the input voltage. This program allows you to calculate the gain of the inverting OpAmp of any circuit.
