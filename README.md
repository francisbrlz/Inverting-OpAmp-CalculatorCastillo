# Inverting-OpAmp-CalculatorCastillo
A non-inverting OpAmp configuration allows you to take any input voltage and amplify it based on the gain (ratio between resistor2 and resistor 1). since the OpAmp configuration is inverted, hence the output will be the opposite or inverted of the input voltage. This program allows you to calculate the gain of the inverting OpAmp of any circuit based on the resistor 1 and resistor 2 connected to the operational amplifier. The formula for the said INVERTING OpAmp gain is -r2/r1=gain and the output voltage is gain x input voltage = output voltage (note that the output voltage will be limited to the OpAmp supply voltage, if the calculated output voltage is greater than the supply voltage, then the output voltage will be the same as the supply voltage). 

To use this program you will need to follow these steps:
1st step: Install netbeans ide if not installed in your laptop.
2nd: open new project in the netbeans ide, click java with maven, then java application
3rd: name the file OpAmpCalculator
4th: copy the code in my github similarly named to the filename i provided.
5th: delete the default code in the ide then paste the code you copied.
6th: click create new file and name the file and InvertingOpAmp
7th: delete the default code (new file) and copy the code in my github name InvertingOpAmp.java and paste it on the new file you created
8th: create new file again and name it InvertingOpAmpGUI
9th: delete the default code (new file) and copy the code in in my github named InvertingOpAmpGUI.java and paste it on the new file.
10th step: check and import necessary files in the ide, check for errors then click the geen botton up the ide to run the code and enjoy.
